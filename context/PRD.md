# BookKeep - Product Requirements Document

## Vision Statement

BookKeep is a modern, collaborative reading tracker that helps users manage their book collections, track reading progress, and share literary experiences with friends. Built with TypeScript and Firebase, it prioritizes real-time collaboration and user experience over architectural complexity.

## Core Value Proposition

- **Personal Library Management**: Track owned books and wishlist items in a unified interface
- **Reading Progress Tracking**: Monitor reading states, progress, and reading statistics
- **Rich Interaction History**: Capture quotes, comments, and reviews as you read
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Share shelves and reading experiences with friends
- **Intelligent Discovery**: Automated metadata from Google Books API
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Visualize reading habits and achievements

## Target Users

**Primary**: Individual readers who want to organize their personal libraries and track reading progress
**Secondary**: Book clubs and reading groups who want to share recommendations and track collective reading

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Authentication & User Management
- **User Registration**: Email/password and social login (Google, GitHub)
- **Profile Management**: Display name, reading preferences, privacy settings
- **Multi-device Sync**: Real-time synchronization across devices

### 2. Book Management

#### Core Book Entity
```typescript
interface Book {
  id: string
  title: string
  author: string
  isbn?: string
  state: 'not_started' | 'in_progress' | 'finished'
  progress?: number // pages read
  isOwned: boolean // true for owned, false for wishlist
  collaborators?: string[] // user IDs with access
  metadata: {
    pages?: number
    genre?: string
    publishedYear?: number
    coverUrl?: string
    description?: string
  }
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

#### Book Operations
- **Add Books**: Manual entry or Google Books API search
- **State Transitions**: not_started → in_progress → finished (with validation)
- **Progress Updates**: Track pages read for in-progress books
- **Ownership Toggle**: Move between owned and wishlist collections
- **Collaboration**: Share books with other users

### 3. Reading State Management

#### State Validation Rules
```typescript
const canStartReading = (book: Book) => book.state === 'not_started' && book.isOwned
const canUpdateProgress = (book: Book) => book.state === 'in_progress'
const canFinish = (book: Book) => book.state === 'in_progress'
const canAddReview = (book: Book) => book.state === 'finished'
```

#### Allowed Operations by State
- **Not Started**: Start reading (owned books only), add to wishlist, share
- **In Progress**: Update progress, add comments/quotes, finish reading
- **Finished**: Add reviews, quotes, afterthoughts

### 4. Event Logging & History

#### Event Types
```typescript
interface BookEvent {
  id: string
  bookId: string
  userId: string
  type: 'state_change' | 'progress_update' | 'comment' | 'quote' | 'review'
  timestamp: Date
  data: {
    // Type-specific data
    comment?: string
    quote?: { text: string; page?: number }
    review?: { rating: number; text: string }
    stateChange?: { from: BookState; to: BookState }
    progressUpdate?: { from: number; to: number }
  }
}
```

#### Event Features
- **Immutable History**: Events are never updated or deleted
- **Timeline View**: Chronological display of all book interactions
- **Activity Feed**: Recent events across user's library
- **Statistics Source**: Events drive reading analytics

### 5. Organization & Shelves

#### Shelf Management
```typescript
interface Shelf {
  id: string
  name: string
  description?: string
  bookIds: string[]
  ownerId: string
  collaborators: string[]
  isPublic: boolean
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

#### Shelf Features
- **Personal Shelves**: Private organization (e.g., "To Read", "Favorites")
- **Collaborative Shelves**: Shared with friends (e.g., "Book Club Picks")
- **Public Shelves**: Discoverable by other users
- **Smart Filters**: Virtual shelves by genre, year, reading state

### 6. Collaboration Features

#### Real-time Sync
- **Live Updates**: Changes appear instantly for all collaborators
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins with timestamp ordering
- **Activity Notifications**: See when collaborators add books or make progress

#### Sharing Capabilities
- **Share Individual Books**: Grant read/write access to specific books
- **Share Shelves**: Collaborative collections with permission levels
- **Reading Together**: Track group reading progress

### 7. Analytics & Statistics

#### Personal Statistics
```typescript
interface UserStatistics {
  booksRead: number
  pagesRead: number
  averageRating: number
  readingStreaks: {
    current: number
    longest: number
  }
  genreBreakdown: Record<string, number>
  yearlyGoals: {
    target: number
    progress: number
  }
}
```

#### Analytics Features
- **Reading Dashboard**: Visual charts of reading habits
- **Goal Tracking**: Set and monitor yearly reading targets
- **Reading Insights**: Average reading speed, favorite genres
- **Progress Visualization**: Timeline of reading milestones

## Technical Requirements

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+, React 18+, TypeScript 5+
