In this directory we are porting the old bookkeep project to typescript, in order to more easily leverage modern libraries, and create a web app that can be used collaboratively with friends.

The tech stack will be the following:
Firebase for auth and databases

Typescript, React, Next.js
Tailwind.css
Framer motion libraries
Vercel / Amplify

Functionality that we will develop in the current Sprint:

1. firebase user auth
2. firebase persistence
3. Access to user statistics, with visualization of reading graphs etc
4. Google Books API book database integration for metadata like photos and other metadata (dont want to enter this manually)

Future integrations:
- Wishlists, separated from actual owned books
- LLM based book reccomendations
- Gameification, like rewards for reading, setting reading goals etc
